<h3>A01 - Broken Access Control</h3>
- Access control enforces polciy that outside users cant act outside the permissions granted for them
<br>
- failure in this -> unauthorized access, modifications etc.
<br>
- Bypassing the access control can be done by modifying the URL,
internal application state or HTML page, or tool modifying APIs
<br>
- API access POST, PUT and DELETE
<br>
Prevention: <br>
-by handling it on trusted server <br>
- default deny-rules <br>
- ownership-based data restrictions <br>
- secure server configs. <br>
- session/tokem lifecycle management <br>
<br>
<h3>Find Hidden Web Directories - Fuzz URLs with ffuf</h3> <br>
- Secret directiories in servers -> finding manually / automatically <br>
- With fuff you can do it automatically <br>

<h3>Access control vulnerabilities and privilege escalation</h3> <br>
- Access control -> whether user is allowed to carry the action <br>
- broken control is common -> critical security vulnerability <br>
- Vertical = restrict access to sensitive functionality to specific type users <br>
- Horizontal = restrict access to specific users <br>
- Context-dependent = restriction based on the state of application or users interaction <br>
- Parameter-based = storing info at login like hidden field, cookie, query string parameter <br>

<h3>Raportin kirjoittaminen</h3> <br>
- Täsmälliset raportoinnit niin että joku muu voisi tehdä raportin perusteella oman työn samalla tavalla <br>
- Millä työkaluilla, kellonajat??, komennot, viat ja imperfekti <br>

<h1>Hack'n Fix</h1>
<br>
<H3>010-staff-only</H3> <br>
To start this lab I opened Oracle VM VirtualBox manager and my Debian (64-bit) virtual machine to complete this assignment.
<br>

<br>
After having logged in into my VM, I opened the command terminal to start the task. In Tero's assignment instructions page (https://terokarvinen.com/hack-n-fix/) there is install requirements. I ran the commands provided. <br>
<img width="803" height="418" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/750f7ee3-af40-49f9-a04b-54f11a095025" />  <br>
<img width="708" height="167" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7686556-450b-41a7-a3ff-398cec489599" />
<br>
I then downloaded the zip file provided
<br>
<img width="401" height="165" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/686f2f22-5574-49dd-9f75-c8c64c27e61d" />
<br>
After downloading I uncompressed the file 
<br>
<img width="401" height="220" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54dde29f-2b30-407e-a7f0-f6c56571affe" />
<br>
After I had made the preliminaries it was time to move to the actual first assignment.
<br>
I started running the assignment as Tero's instructions told me to. Running the commands it told me to download python3-flask in order for me to be able to continue. <br>
<img width="401" height="106" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c5428cf-555e-41f1-af27-4f42e9892365" />
<br>
<img width="443" height="24" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4890a9ab-ba11-4bd1-a66f-24ece76c3012" />
<br>
After successfully downloading the package mentioned I ran the command again, which now worked. <br>
<img width="448" height="104" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59dbaa16-b6ba-41c6-9db8-9c6f00bd6593" />
<br>
I then opened the web browser using the IP provided in terminal <br>
<img width="299" height="278" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f34055d-bf4b-4695-98dc-234f35233b2b" /> <br>
I had been quite stuck in this. I tried first to use URL modification to find the password but quickly realized it won't work that way. I realized that SQL injection must be put into the PIN section. Using the injections wouldn't work before bypassing the input type, since it accepted only numbers. So I had to modify it in DevTools <br>
<img width="107" height="138" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd709d64-13cb-41ad-a25c-7bc88b8bdd69" />
<br>
I used SQL like 123 OR 1=1 but that clearly didn't work because it returned (not found) as a password, so zero rows were matched.
<br>
I used also 123 OR 1=1 LIMIT ?,1    with ? being different row numbers but kept getting (not found). After fighting with this lab for several hours I decided to quit trying. 
<br>
What I did learn was that client doesn't mean secure, I could easily bypass the number input type by modifying the code. I understood that OR 1=1 needs to be used with something before it. I understood why LIMIT is needed to get answer just from certain row not everything. Bypassing the number validation one could inject the SQL logic that would cause WHERE to evaluate to true, with LIMIT this can be used to control which row to return to get the correct password. Unfortunately I wasn't able to retrieve the "SUPERADMIN" password.

<br>
I still kept trying and I got some progress after I changed the SQL injection to ' OR 1=1 -- LIMIT 0,1. I got password as "foo" which meant I was bypassing authentication correctly, just not the right data yet. But that was as far as I got. I kept changing the LIMIT value manually but it kept returning "foo" as password.

<h3>Find Hidden Web Directories - Fuzz URLs with ffuf</h3>
<br>
I started this assignment by downloading the sample target from Tero's website https://terokarvinen.com/2023/fuzz-urls-find-hidden-directories/   
<br>
<img width="448" height="158" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbc95ac3-764d-4a3a-af30-aec679150429" /> <br>
<br>
I then made changes to file permissions and then ran the file which provided the URL for me. <br>
<img width="296" height="53" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1fb80ec-b863-4636-8401-c3c6fbd09515" />
<br> 
Then I opened the web browser, and my practice environment were running now. <br>
<img width="272" height="79" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9be995f-e588-4234-a20e-76e0423a10e8" /> <br>
I then downloaded fuff, so instead of me trying the URL's manually, fuff would try ones automatically. <br>
<img width="445" height="229" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5a3e869-6555-49ef-8dfb-42cf7303457f" /> <br>
<br>
Then I had to download dictionary, I downloaded one online provided in Tero's website. <br>
<img width="449" height="182" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a34c3aaa-d77c-49b4-abe3-4373713bcbb1" /> <br>
I kept getting errors.
<img width="434" height="251" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ceb586e-1478-4da1-8c5e-f677422722fe" /> <br> 
I then checked if my server was running and it kept giving me "failed to connect" <br>
<img width="447" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad82edf7-e9ed-4fbd-a078-e3a32568551c" /> <br>
My ffuf was downloaded but couldn't reach the server it kept giving me errors.
