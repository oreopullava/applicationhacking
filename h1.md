After writing the code I opened CMD to run the code:

Here I realized this cannot be turned into binary. 
So i started doing new code using C, wanted to use Linux but I had to create new server and couldnt make it so,
I COULDNT MAKE THE FIRST ASSIGNMENT. wanted to do it but time finished.... I'll try to do it after class, even though I need to submit report now
