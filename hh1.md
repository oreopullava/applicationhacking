<h1>a) Baseline</h1>
Task: Draft the ISMS scope for your home network and study lab:

<h3>1. What is included in scope
Home network basic infrastructure:</h3>
home Wi-Fi DNA-WIFI-A96C, personal with password
Router for Wi-Fi used DNA F-3896 Kaapelimodeemi Wi-Fi 6

<h3>Devices used for exerices:</h3>
Laptop Lenovo YOGA 7
Oracle VM virtualbox
iPhone 12 pro max

for Information I use moodle, github reps, and different accounts when needed.


 
<h3>2. What you exclude and why</h3>
I exclude my XBOX, TV and since I live alone there is no other family devices. These devices are not used for study-related 
work, so I only include the things that handle and are relevant for coursework. My TV and XBOX don't store, process any information
related and are only for entertainment. Since I live alone no other members use my network.


 
3. Key interfaces
For my cloud services I use GitHub for storing homework submissions, Moodle for managing the course environment and
OneDrive for notes etc.

Remote access (VPN, SSH, RDP) may be needed to secure remote connectivity

Suppliers: ISP operator is DNA, device vendor like Lenovo, Apple and Oracle for VirtualBox, cloud service provider GitHub, Google,
Microsoft and Haaga-Helia



One simple network and interface diagram (boxes + arrows is sufficient) showing:

b) Tie It to the Standard

Me: as a owner I ewquire that my devices, connection and data is available and secure, links to ISO 27001 areas of Leadership, Planning, and Operation.


Cloud services (GitHub, Google, Microsoft) – account security, MFA, compliance with terms: Cloud platforms require 
that I use secure authentication and comply with terms of service. ISO 27001 Operation and Performance Evaluation, because it involves secure access control and monitoring account activity
